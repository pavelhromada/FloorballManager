# FloorballManager

This is a simple application made for friends (for free :)) using Qt 5.10 framework. Its purpose 
is just to help with selection of players into teams, show scoreboard with actual score of the game,
ability to record goals scored by particular players and the last but not least to provide statistics
of particular games and players.
